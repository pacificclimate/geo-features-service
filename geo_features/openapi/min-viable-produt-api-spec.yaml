      For the moment, we are using [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/)
      (see also [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON))
      as the model of what "feature" should mean.
      In particular, we are thinking
      that a feature in this service corresponds to a single GeoJSON object.
      However, note that GeoJSON objects can contain collections of simpler
      features such as polygons. This identification of service feature with
      GeoJSON object is subject to revision as this service is developed.

      Questions:

      1. What data formats should be supported?
         1. This will be driven in part by what data formats our (PCIC)
            client apps like to consume.
         1. GeoJSON? This is also a natural internal storage format.
         1. WKT?
         1. Others?
